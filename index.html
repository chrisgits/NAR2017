          <p>Combined, NAR partners have over 60 years of experience in crash and crime scene investigations and analysis.</p>
          <p>This includes on-scene investigations, follow-up vehicle exams and working with clients to understand the crash from the time the case starts to the courtroom.</p>

          <h2>tech</h2>
          <p>NAR partners are certified in the use of the latest recon technologies. Their partners are able to digitally map crash scenes so that 3D models can be created to help tell the story of how the crash occurred. They are also certified in the EDR technologies explained on our Services <a href="services.html">page</a>.</p>
          <p>These abilities allow NAR to provide the answers needed to attorneys and insurance companies to help them make informed decisions on whether or not their clients or insured parties should pursue further legal actions or claims.</p>
          <p>NAR partners are also experienced in criminal defense and civil litigation cases where clients need to find out what the evidence shows occurred in the collision.</p>

          <p>With <span class="brandtxt">NAR-LLC</span> having extensive field experience, its partners know all too well that seatbelt use can save lives and helps prevent serious injury or death in thousands of crashes every year. Recent statistics in Nebraska alone show that nearly 70% of fatalities in passenger cars were NOT wearing seatbelts. While some crashes are not survivable no matter the safety system, many survivable crashes occur every day where seatbelt use is a critical factor in the reduction of injuries or chances of death.</p>
