            <p>NAR prides itself in being a team-based organization. In the reconstruction community it is important to have peer-review and specialists in the many different disciplines of the crash reconstruction field. For over 10 years NAR has provided honest answers and accurate analysis for its clients.</p>
            <p>We know that in the courtroom it not only takes the technical expertise and understanding of complex concepts but the ability to explain those concepts in ways that allow the judge or jury to form their own conclusions based on an accurate understanding of what took place before and during the crash event.</p>
